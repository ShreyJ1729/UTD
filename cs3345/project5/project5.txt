Project #5

Due Dates:  Saturday, April 22 at 11:59pm 

Submit:    eLearning

Late Policy:  24-hour late period, then zero points

Instructions: This is an individual assignment.  All work should be your own.



Objective:

    Write a program to produce a topological sort of a graph.


Overview:

    In this project you will use a topological sort on a graph from an input file in adjacency list form.


Details:

    Create a class called TopSortGraph.

    The structure of this class in terms of fields, methods, and inner classes will be up to you.
    Points will be reduced if your program is not well organized and commented.

    Basic requirements are:

      1) Input a file graph.txt that contains the graph in adjacency list form.
      2) Perform a topological sort of the graph, outputting the result.

    You are expected to write the topological sort code yourself following the pseudocode found in both the
    slides and in the textbook.  You may not use code for a topological sort found in other sources.

    Your output should be a list of node values separated by commas.
    The program should work on any similar input file.  You may assume the file has valid data.
