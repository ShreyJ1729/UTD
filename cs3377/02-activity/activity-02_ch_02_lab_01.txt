1. Use the following command to cause the shell you are running to display its name: echo $0

$ echo $0

2. Enter this incorrect command: ls -lst on a command line then press RETURN. Now using the arrow edit keys, correct the command to
be ls -l as explained starting in Sobell.

$ ls -lst

3. You can use man pages to learn about Unix utilities and other aspects of a Unix system (Sobell,). Read the man page on the man
utility to find out more about this utility.

$ man man

4. Do a man page on the cat command.

$ man cat

5. Many utilities display a message that is so long it scrolls off the screen. In this case you can use a pipeline (covered in a later lab;
Sobell) and a pager such as less (Sobell) to display one screen of information at a time.
Man the cp utility and send the output through a pipeline to less.

$ man cp | less

6. Use man to display information about the echo built-in command.

$ man echo
